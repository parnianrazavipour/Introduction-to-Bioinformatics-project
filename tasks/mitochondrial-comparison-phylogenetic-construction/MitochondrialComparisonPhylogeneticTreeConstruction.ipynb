    "This task focuses on the comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes from different species, primarily birds, mammals, and insects. The aim is to understand the evolutionary relationships between these species by analyzing and comparing their mitochondrial DNA, which is about 16,000 base pairs in length. You will use advanced computational methods to construct phylogenetic trees and delve into the ecological and anthropological insights that can be gleaned from this data. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial genomics, its importance in evolutionary biology, and its applications in broader scientific contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Techniques for aligning and comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences.\n",
    "- How to construct and interpret phylogenetic trees using advanced computational methods.\n",
    "- The application of mitochondrial genomics in understanding ecological interactions and human evolutionary history.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mitochondrial Genome Comparison**:\n",
    "   - Align mitochondrial DNA sequences from the provided dataset.\n",
    "   - Analyze these sequences to identify similarities and differences across species.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phylogenetic Analysis Using Advanced Methods**:\n",
    "   - Apply Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference methods, utilizing tools like `ETE Toolkit`, `DendroPy`, `BEAST`, or `PyRate`.\n",
    "   - Compare the trees generated by these methods to understand how different approaches can lead to different interpretations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Disciplinary Applications (Bonus)**:\n",
    "   - **Ecology**: Examine how mitochondrial DNA analysis can reveal information about species adaptation, migration, and conservation. This involves understanding how genetic variation within and between species can inform ecological strategies and conservation efforts.\n",
    "   - **Anthropology**: Investigate the use of mitochondrial DNA in tracing human evolution and migration patterns. This includes studying the mitochondrial DNA of mammals in your dataset to draw parallels with human evolutionary studies.\n",

    "### Exploration and Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "As we proceed with our analysis of mitochondrial DNA for phylogenetic tree construction, it is valuable to contemplate a few questions. These inquiries aim to facilitate a more thorough understanding of the roles and characteristics of mitochondrial DNA in the context of evolutionary biology:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Maternal Inheritance and Its Implications**: How does the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA simplify our understanding of evolutionary lineage compared to nuclear DNA, which undergoes recombination? What unique insights can this aspect provide in tracing the evolutionary history of species?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mutation Rate and Evolutionary Insights**: Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a faster rate than nuclear DNA. How does this characteristic make mtDNA a more sensitive tool for detecting recent evolutionary events and relationships among closely related species? Can you think of any specific scenarios or studies where this property of mtDNA has been particularly instrumental?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflect on these questions as you work through the project, and consider how the properties of mitochondrial DNA enhance its value and applicability in evolutionary biology and beyond. Provide your answer either in this notebook, or in your report (if you had one).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Species Selection**: Identify and choose 10 additional species to include in your dataset. Aim for a diverse selection to enrich your phylogenetic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying NCBI Database**: Use the NCBI database to locate mitochondrial DNA sequences for your chosen species. While you can manually search on the [NCBI website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), consider automating this process through their API for a more efficient approach.\n",
    "    - **Example Query**: As a starting point, you might use a query like `\"mitochondrion[Filter] AND (your_species_name[Organism])` to find specific mtDNA sequences. Adjust the query parameters according to your species selection.\n",
    "    - **Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the [NCBI API documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/) for detailed guidance on constructing queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using NCBI Website**: You are welcome to use the NCBI website for this task. If you do so, document each step of your process clearly in your task report. This should include the species names, search terms used, and how you determined the relevant sequences to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bonus Opportunity**: Implementing an automated, methodological approach using the NCBI API and relevant Python packages to add all 10 records in your dataset will earn you a 50% bonus for this section. Your method should be structured and replicable, demonstrating a systematic approach to data collection.\n",
